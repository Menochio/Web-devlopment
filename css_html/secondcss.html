    <h1>SECOND CSS PROJECT ON CUTTLEFISH</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Cuttlefish or cuttles[2] are marine molluscs of the order Sepiida. They belong to the class Cephalopoda, which
        also includes squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
        is used for control of buoyancy.

    <p>
        Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopus, worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators
        include dolphins, sharks, fish, seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical life expectancy of a
        cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent
        invertebrates.[4] Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all invertebrates.[4]

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>
    <p>The family Sepiidae, which contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters. They are mostly
        shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[10] They have an
        unusual biogeographic pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western Europe, and the
        Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the
        time the family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly had become too cold and deep
        for these warm-water species to cross</p>

    <h2>Anatomy and physiology</h2>
    <p>Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes. The organogenesis and the final structure of the
        cephalopod eye fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates such as humans.[14] Superficial similarities
        between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil
        is a smoothly curving W-shape.[15][16] Although cuttlefish cannot see color,[17] they can perceive the
        polarization of light, which enhances their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor
        cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and one to look more backward. The eye
        changes focus by shifting the position of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the
        lens as in mammals.</p>
